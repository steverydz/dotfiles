# Ubuntu dotfiles

These dotfiles are customised for me for my job at Canonical where I use Ubuntu. They enable me to get up and running on a new Ubuntu install. You are free to fork and use them but if you do you're on your own.

## Packages to install

```
build-essential
curl
docker-compose
git
python3.6
python3-pip
python3-venv
tmux
vim
wget
zsh
xclip
```

## Install tmux package manager
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

# Ubuntu dotfiles

These dotfiles are customised for me for my job at Canonical where I use Ubuntu. They enable me to get up and running on a new Ubuntu install. You are free to fork and use them but if you do you're on your own.

## How to use

1. Save the [setup script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steverydz/dotfiles/master/setup.sh) to your local machine
1. Make sure it is executable: `sudo chmod +x setup.sh`
1. Run the script: `./setup.sh`

You will be prompted for your password for commands that use `sudo`.
